        <p class="tldr">
          Provide a thorough overview of what the element does, and provide
          examples of common usage patterns. Format the documentation as
          markdown.
        </p>

        If the element declares a `<dom-module>`, write the documentation as
        HTML comments **immediately** preceeding that `<dom-module>`

            <link rel="import" href="../polymer/polymer.html">

            <!--
            `<awesome-sauce>` injects a healthy dose of awesome into your page.

            In typical use, just slap some `<awesome-sauce>` at the top of your body:

                <body>
                  <awesome-sauce></awesome-sauce>

            Wham! It's all awesome now!
            -->
            <dom-module id="awesome-sauce">

        Note that the doc comment should be **after** any dependencies.

        If your element lacks a `<dom-module>`, write documentation via a JSDoc
        comment attached to its `Polymer()` call:

            /**
             * `<awesome-sauce>` injects a healthy dose of awesome into your page.
             *
             * In typical use, just slap some `<awesome-sauce>` at the top of your body:
             *
             *     <body>
             *       <awesome-sauce></awesome-sauce>
             *
             * Wham! It's all awesome now!
             */
            Polymer({
              is: 'awesome-sauce',

        Element-level can be added at the **end** of the element summary, as part of the same comment block. 
        Two tags are supported currently:

        *   `@hero`. Specifies a hero image.

                @hero path/to/image

        *   `@demo`. Specifies a demo, with optional path and description. If path and description are omitted,
            the standard demo path (`./demo/`) is assumed.

                @demo

                @demo path/to/demo1  Super cool demo, with sharks!
                @demo path/to/demo2  Even cooler demo. The sharks have lasers!

        Other tags will be ignored. 
                
        **Note: Any tags placed _before_ the end of the comment block are interpreted as the end 
        of the element summary.**

    <section>
      <a is="sg-header">Properties</a>
      <marked-element><script type="text/markdown">
        <p class="tldr">
          Document all public properties. Docs should start with a one line
          summary. Make sure that the property's type is annotated.
        </p>

        For example, the most simple property documentation can be a single
        line:

            /** Whether this element is currently awesome. */
            isAwesome: Boolean,

        If the property doesn't specifiy a type, or that type is not primitive,
        be sure to [annotate](#type-annotation) the type properly:

            /**
             * Metadata describing what has been made awesome on the page.
             *
             * @type {{elements: Array<HTMLElement>, level: number}}
             */
            sauce: Object,

        Private properties should be prefixed with `_`
        
            /** @return {string} An awesome message */
            _getMessage: function() {

      </script></marked-element>
    </section>

    <section>
      <a is="sg-header">Methods</a>
      <marked-element><script type="text/markdown">
        <p class="tldr">
          Follow the [property guidelines](#properties). Additionally, make sure
          the types for all params and return values are documented.
        </p>

        For example:

            /**
             * Applies awesomeness to `element`.
             *
             * @param {HTMLElement} element The element to be made awesome.
             * @param {number} level The numeric level of awesomeness. A value
             *     between `1` and `11`.
             * @param {Array<HTMLElements>=} refs Optional referenced elements
             *     that become awesome by proxy.
             * @return {number} The cumulative level of awesomeness.
             */
            makeAwesome: function makeAwesome(element, level, refs) {

      </script></marked-element>
    </section>

    <section>
      <a is="sg-header">Events</a>
      <marked-element><script type="text/markdown">
        <p class="tldr">
          Events must be annotated explicitly with an <code>@event</code> tag. 
        </p>

        Event properties are documented with the `@param` tag, just like method parameters.

        For example:

            /**
             * Fired when `element` changes its awesomeness level.
             *
             * @event awesome-change
             * @param {number} newAwesome New level of awesomeness.
             */

    <section>
      <a is="sg-header">Behaviors</a>
      <marked-element><script type="text/markdown">
        <p class="tldr">Like an element, but add <code>@polymerBehavior</code>.</p>

        Include a behavior summary, just like an element summary, but ending with a
        `@polymerBehavior` tag. The behavior name can be specified explicitly if the 
        doc parser can't infer it correctly. 

            @polymerBehavior MyOddBehavior

        Document methods, properties, etc. just like an element.

        For example: 

            /**
             * Behavior that highlights stuff. 
             *
             * @polymerBehavior
             */

            MyBehaviors.HighlightStuff = { ... }

        When extending a behavior, you place the _new_ functionality 
        in an implementation object as described in [Extending behaviors](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/behaviors.html#extending).

        The implementation object **must** be named with the behavior name followed
        by `Impl`, and it must be annotated with `@polymerBehavior` _followed by 
        the real behavior name_:

            /**
             * Extended behavior. 
             *
             * @polymerBehavior SuperBehavior
             */
            MyBehaviors.SuperBehaviorImpl = { ... }

        The actual behavior is simply an array of behaviors, ending with the implementation 
        object. It must also be annotated with `@polymerBehavior`:

            /**
             * @polymerBehavior 
             */
            MyBehaviors.SuperBehavior = [MyBehaviors.BaseBehavior, MyBehaviors.SuperBehaviorImpl]

        The documentation system merges these declarations into a single behavior 
        (in this case, `MyBehaviors.SuperBehavior`).

          When in doubt, keep to the 3rd person present tense and keep it
          simple.
        </p>

        A few guidelines for consistency:

        * Use the 3rd person for descriptions.

          * Good. "Creates a foo."
          * Avoid. "Create a foo."

          Use 2nd person ("Do this...") when you're _trying_ to be prescriptive,
          such as, "**Add** the `toolbar` attribute to the element you want
          to use as a toolbar."

        * Use the present tense whenever possible.

          * Good. "Clicking the element starts an animation."
          * Avoid. "Clicking the element will start an animation."

        * Start method descriptions with an active verb.

          * Good. "Starts the animation."
          * Avoid. "This method to starts the animation."

        * It's OK to use a fragment, especially in a short description.

          * Good. "Item height, in pixels."
          * Avoid. "This property specifies the item height, in pixels."

          (Fragments should still start with a capital letter and
          have ending punctuation.)

        The [JavaDoc Style Guide](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-137868.html#styleguide)
        is a good resource on general API doc style. Most of the style rules
        described there can be applied here as well.
