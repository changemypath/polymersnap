# neon-elements

The neon elements are for flashy transitions and animations.

## Roadmap

### Elements in progress

_No elements currently in progress - we release the `neon-animations` component which contains a ton of neat animation features, including much of the behavior previously in `core-animated-pages`._

### Elements planned
_Elements we're planning on building soon but haven't started yet_

[Lot's we're planning on here, but nothing explicit to list. If there are specific animations you'd like to see, feel free to file issues!]

### Elements not planned, notably
_Elements we're not planning on building as part of this product line, but that one might be wondering about_

[None]
