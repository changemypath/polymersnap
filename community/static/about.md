WebComponents.org aims to make it easy to share and discover reusable web UI components. As well as a place to publish, browse and search for components, WebComponents.org provides articles, presentations, podcasts, tools and more to help web professionals build first-class DOM objects in the browsers. All the content on this site is totally free, and contributions are welcome.

This site will be a long-term project committed to making the web better by sharing peer-reviewed custom elements that are usable across all browsers, and interoperable with existing libraries. The Web Component APIs are the result of broad collaboration between browser vendors. This site is intended to be a place for broad developer collaboration across libraries and frameworks to make the most of these powerful new APIs.
