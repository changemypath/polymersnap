JavaScript is a playground. If you disagree, then I encourage you to read Atwoodâ€™s Law. A quick Google search will reveal the law in full force with assemblers, machine emulators, and programming languages all written in JavaScript. That is just a small sampling. Go peruse the npm registry for plenty of build tools, frameworks, and servers written in JavaScript. We are tinkerers, especially in the JavaScript community. Sometimes our creations are practical and sometimes they are just fun.

With that introduction framing this post, I would like to show off some fun I had with [Polymer](http://polymer-project.org/) and [Marionette.js](http://marionettejs.com/) recently.
