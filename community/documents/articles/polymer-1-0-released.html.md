Today we’re incredibly excited to announce the 1.0 release of the Polymer library.

Since the 0.5 “Developer Preview” release, we’ve re-written the library from the ground up, focusing on cross-browser performance while keeping the developer-friendly ergonomics. The new library is 3x faster on Chrome, 4x faster on Safari, and 36% less code than in developer preview. And it’s ready to be used in production applications.
