This presentation is just like the song: a friendly nudge to look ahead at the great things coming the Web’s way. Sure, we <3 AngularJS, and if you’re like us, you probably do too. But we are also very excited about the future: the future of Angular and the future of the web.

<!-- Excerpt -->

In this talk we would like to show how we can build awesome things using AngularJS and Web Components. We will first speak about Web Components and the different specifications that make them what they are, like Shadow DOM, HTML Templates, HTML Imports and Custom Elements(`<mega-button>`s anyone?), and then look at how we can integrate them with the AngularJS of today. And of course, this talk wouldn’t be about the future, if we didn’t mention the  much talked about 2.0 and the part that Web Components will play in it.
