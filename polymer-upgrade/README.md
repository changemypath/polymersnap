# Moved!

This tool has been merged into the [Polymer Linter](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-linter).

It can detect problems, and with the `--fix` option or a Code Action in your IDE, automatically fix them too. Configure it with the `polymer-2-hybrid` rule collection for help migrating to Polymer 2.0.

For more info see:
  - [Polymer Linter](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-linter)
  - [polymer --lint](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli#polymer-lint---rules-rule_set-options) in the Polymer CLI.
  - [Polymer Editor Service](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-editor-service) for linting and fixing in your IDE.
