  /**
   * Element class mixin that provides API for lazily upgrading Polymer Elements.
   *
   * This mixin can be used to lazily upgrade elements that are descendants of this element.
   * This is useful for elements that have expensive descendants that are not necessary for
   * the first rendering.
   *
   * To lazily upgrade descendant elements, those elements must have
   * `disable-upgrade` and `lazy-upgrade` attributes.
   * In addition, `<dom-if>` elements can be lazily displayed with just the
   * `lazy-upgrade` attribute.
   *
   * The `lazy-upgrade` attribute can be given an optional priority value.
   * The higher the value, the lower the priority. Default priority is 0.
   *
   * When upgrading elements, the mixin will upgrade as many as it can within the budget
   * set by `_lazyUpgradeBudget`, which defaults to 16ms.
   *
   * When finished processing lazy-upgrade elements, this mixin will set `_lazyUpgrading`
   * to false on the host.
   *
