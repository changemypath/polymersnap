<p>Think about how you load different types of resources on the web. For JS, we have &lt;script src=&quot;&quot;&gt;. For CSS, your go-to is probably &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&lt;. For images it's &lt;img>&gt;. Video has &lt;video&gt;. Audio, &lt;audio&gt;â€¦ Get to the point! The majority of the web's content has a simple and declarative way to load itself. Not so for HTML.</p>
