If we could list a Top 10 Web Components' Early Adopters, this guy would definitely be one of them. He's the founder of [Divshot](https://divshot.com/), a company that helps developers build better static web apps, and created several tools that you might heard already.

Ladies and gentlemen, let's continue our [interview series](/tags/interview) with [Michael Bleigh](https://twitter.com/mbleigh) sharing his motivations behind Web Components.

<!-- Excerpt -->

### Your company launched some really interesting projects around Web Components. What motivates you to invest on this?

It's pretty simple, really. I'm investing in Web Components because in two to three years every web application being built will be using them extensively. Web Components represent the most important advancement in browser technology since AJAX. I've always been driven to make things that make web development better, and there's no better place to be doing that right now.

I started Divshot with the goal of building a platform for the front-end as sophisticated as the platforms we have for the back-end. Modern browsers are incredibly capable software platforms, and those small gaps that do exist are being plugged by Web Components (also Service Workers). If we invest in Web Components today, we'll have deeper and better knowledge of how to build our products for the future.

Most developers don't yet know what Web Components are, much less why they should care. It won't be long, however, until the first killer app for Web Components is going to ship. After that, it's all gravity. I'm just be thrilled to play a part (however small or large) in the coming revolution.

### Every developer has their own workflow to compose and share their Web Components. How do you think tools like [ele.io](https://ele.io/) can improve that?

Online tools are going to play a prominent role in a Web Components world. Ele is just one small expression of that. I love Web Components for what they offer me as a seasoned web developer, but the possibilities are mind-boggling if you think of the potential uses for less-experienced developers. A structured language like HTML is fundamentally easier to grasp to outsiders than learning to write JavaScript.

Today, you can sit down with a newcomer, the Bootstrap docs (or a tool like Divshot), and a couple of hours and you can show them how to piece together a non-interactive web page. With Web Components, that capability is orders of magnitude greater. We're already seeing how previously "script-only" things are becoming declarative thanks to Web Components (like `<google-map>` or `<core-ajax>`). I don't know where exactly the road leads, but tools built from the ground up for Web Components have the potential to do things that I could only dream about two years ago.

There's never going to be a one-size-fits all workflow for web development. That's why perhaps the greatest advantage Web Components offer is interoperability. One person can build something with X-Tag, another can build with Polymer, and amazingly those two elements can function well together! We're so accustomed to framework silos (jQuery plugins, Angular directives, etc. etc.) that it's almost hard to imagine a more compatible world.

### [Built with Polymer](http://builtwithpolymer.org/) was another nice initiative to highlight the community's work. Is there anything you think the community is still missing that could help it grow?

There are two ways to grow the usage of any technology: top-down and bottom-up. I think there are big opportunities for both in the Web Components world.

The path to bottom-up adoption is already happening. All it takes is for people to build cool reusable custom elements that provide a better developer experience than anything available in existing frameworks and libraries. We don't have a sure-fire killer app just yet (though core and paper elements are really addictive), but I'm convinced we'll get there soon. I'd also like to see modern front-end libraries ship with an official Web Components option as part of the best practices for releasing something. It would be great to see jaw-dropping projects like Impulse get an "official" (or at least blessed) Web Components wrapper.

The top-down approach is also interesting. All it will take is for a major property like Facebook, Twitter, or YouTube to offer official custom elements as the primary way to embed their content and you'll see adoption skyrocket overnight. Imagine if putting a Like button on your website was done with an import link and an `<fb-like>` tag instead of the current hacked-together custom way. For that to happen, though, we're going to have to see browser support that gives the major players confidence to make that kind of move. It's probably at least a year or two out.

### You created one of the [first Web Components meetups](http://www.meetup.com/Web-Components-LA) in Los Angeles, CA. Do you think there is enough content for an event dedicated to that area? What are your plans for it?

I was pretty surprised when I looked and there wasn't already one in the Bay Area. I guess maybe LA's just a little bit ahead right now when it comes to tech. ;)

There's plenty of content, but not always enough people who know the content and want to present it. We're building a community from scratch so I've accepted that I'll be presenting something almost every month for a while. But for content, there's a Web Components spin that can be put on any topic pertinent to front-end development in general today. There are hundreds of HTML5, Angular, Ember, etc. meetups, and someday there will be hundreds of Web Components meetups as well!

My plans for the group? First we get people excited about Web Components, then we get them building and sharing reusable elements, then we take over the world! Or just build really cool stuff, that last bit's still up in the air.
