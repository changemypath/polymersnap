<p>It’s a different web today. It’s a different way of thinking about UI components on a page. The Polymer, X-tag, and other libraries have stepped up to help abstract some of the complexities of the Web Component Specifications. Projects like Customelements.io & Component.Kitchen have helped us find components but much of the documentation, use cases, and content surrounding Web Components is scattered across the web. We aim to alleviate this random distribution and centralize Web Component content. This will enable us to share knowledge, code, and tooling much faster & in much greater depth across the Web Components ecosystem.</p>
