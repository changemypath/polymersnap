<p>WebComponents.org is the canonical resource for all material related to Web Components development. Web Components provide a new and standard way of building UI components. It’s a lot to absorb all at once and very different from most of the previous ways to work with UI on the web. WebComponents.org provides articles, presentations, podcasts, interviews, original content, resources, tools and much more to assist designers, developers, and other web professionals build components that are (or will be) ‘first class’ DOM objects in the browsers. Our content is totally free and we welcome contributions on to content and other resources such as polyfills & tools maintained by our Github organization.</p>
