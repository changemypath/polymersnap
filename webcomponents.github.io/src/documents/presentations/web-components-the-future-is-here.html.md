Web development has changed dramatically over the last few years. With the enormous amount of JavaScript libraries and the new HTML5 standard, today it is easier to create rich Internet applications (RIA). When building RIAs, you will probably want to reuse some of the web components you built. But how you can do that with the current state of HTML?

<!-- Excerpt -->

One of the new and emerging standards in HTML5 is Web Components. The Web Components standard enables you to create reusable web components that include both HTML and JavaScript. In this session, Gil will make you familiar with the Web Components standard and you will learn how to use it even today. He will also explore libraries such as Polymer and X-Tag.
