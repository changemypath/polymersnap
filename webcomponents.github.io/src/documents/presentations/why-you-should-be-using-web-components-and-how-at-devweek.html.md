In this session, Phil will explain what Web Components are, the state of native support in web browsers, what your options are for building componentised web apps right now using AngularJS, Ember, Knockout or React, and why Web Components probably are the future of web development.

<!-- Excerpt -->

He will also cover the benefits of a component-based architecture and how it helps when building JavaScript apps, as well as how components can communicate in a loosely coupled way, and why.
